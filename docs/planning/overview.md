## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

### Overview
The agentic workflow system is significantly enhanced through integration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), transforming it from a sophisticated but static framework into a dynamic, extensible ecosystem capable of unlimited capability expansion.

### Key MCP Benefits

**Dynamic Capabilities**:
- **Runtime Discovery**: Agents discover and integrate new tools and data sources dynamically
- **External Service Integration**: Seamless connection to Git, databases, APIs, file systems, IDEs, CI/CD, monitoring tools
- **Real-time Data Access**: Live access to current project status, system metrics, and external information
- **Custom Extensions**: Framework for creating specialized MCP servers for domain-specific workflows

**Enhanced Intelligence**:
- **Context-Aware Decisions**: Agents make decisions based on real-time external data and system state
- **Adaptive Reasoning**: Reasoning patterns (CoT, ReAct) enhanced with dynamic capability awareness
- **Multi-Source Information**: Access to diverse data sources for comprehensive analysis
- **Collaborative Intelligence**: Shared external resources enable enhanced multi-agent coordination

### Design Patterns and Strategies

1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps to improve reasoning and decision-making.

2. **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)**: Combine reasoning and acting in a loop to allow agents to reflect on their actions and adjust accordingly.

3. **Self-Refine**: Enable agents to evaluate their outputs and refine them for better quality and accuracy.

4. **RAISE (Reasoning, Acting, Interacting, Self-Evaluating)**: A comprehensive approach that includes reasoning, acting, interacting with other agents, and self-evaluation.

5. **Reflexion**: Use reflection techniques to allow agents to learn from past experiences and improve future performance.

6. **LATM (LLMs as Tool Makers)**: Allow agents to create their own tools when necessary, enhancing their ability to handle diverse tasks.

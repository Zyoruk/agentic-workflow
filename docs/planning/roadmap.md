# Design and Development Process

## 1. Define Specific Use Cases
- Identify scenarios or projects where the workflow will be applied.
- Tailor the workflow to meet real-world needs.

## 2. Select Tools and Technologies
- Choose appropriate tools and technologies for each stage of the workflow.
- Consider AI frameworks, CI/CD tools, and collaboration platforms.

## 3. Design the Architecture
- Create a high-level architecture diagram outlining components and interactions.
- Include agents, data flow, and integration points.

## 4. Prototype Key Components
- Develop prototypes for critical components such as task clarification agents, code generation modules, and testing frameworks.

## 5. Establish Metrics and KPIs
- Define metrics and key performance indicators to measure effectiveness and efficiency.

## 6. Plan for Iterative Development
- Set up a plan for iterative development and testing.
- Allow for continuous improvement and adaptation based on feedback.

## 7. Engage Stakeholders
- Involve stakeholders in the design process to gather input and ensure alignment with organizational goals.

## 8. Document the Design

# Custom MCP Servers

## Overview

This document outlines opportunities for creating custom MCP servers specifically tailored to the agentic workflow system. These servers would provide specialized capabilities that enhance the system's software development and AI agent coordination features.

## Why Custom MCP Servers?

### Domain-Specific Optimization
While community MCP servers provide general functionality, custom servers can:
- **Optimize for Agentic Workflows**: Tailor operations specifically for AI agent coordination
- **Integrate System Knowledge**: Leverage internal system architecture and patterns
- **Provide Specialized Tools**: Create tools that don't exist in the general ecosystem
- **Enhance Performance**: Optimize for specific use cases and data patterns

### Seamless Integration
Custom servers can integrate deeply with existing components:
- **Memory System Integration**: Direct access to Redis, Weaviate, and Neo4j
- **Agent Framework Knowledge**: Understanding of reasoning patterns and agent capabilities
- **Event System Integration**: Publish and subscribe to internal events
- **Monitoring Integration**: Native Prometheus metrics and logging

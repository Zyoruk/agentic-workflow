# MCP Integration with Advanced Reasoning and Communication

This document describes how the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation integrates with the new advanced reasoning patterns and communication systems introduced in the agentic workflow framework.

## Integration Overview

The MCP implementation has been enhanced to seamlessly integrate with:

1. **Advanced Reasoning Patterns** - Chain of Thought, ReAct, and RAISE reasoning
2. **Multi-Agent Communication System** - Agent-to-agent coordination and insight sharing
3. **Enhanced Tool Integration** - Unified tool discovery and execution across all systems

## Enhanced MCPEnhancedAgent

The `MCPEnhancedAgent` class now provides comprehensive integration:

```python
from agentic_workflow.mcp.integration.agents import MCPEnhancedAgent
from agentic_workflow.core.communication import CommunicationManager

# Create communication manager for multi-agent coordination
comm_manager = CommunicationManager()

# Create MCP-enhanced agent with reasoning and communication
agent = MCPEnhancedAgent(
    agent_id="advanced_agent",
    communication_manager=comm_manager,
    mcp_enabled=True,
    reasoning_enabled=True,
    default_reasoning_pattern="chain_of_thought",
    auto_discover_servers=True
)

await agent.initialize()
```

### Key Enhancements

**1. Reasoning Integration**
- Automatic reasoning pattern selection based on task type
- MCP capability awareness in reasoning decisions
- Context-aware tool selection and usage

**2. Communication Integration**
- Multi-agent coordination through communication manager
- Insight sharing about MCP capabilities
- Coordinated tool usage across agent networks

**3. Tool System Integration**
- Unified access to MCP tools, built-in tools, and new system tools
- Intelligent tool execution prioritization
- Comprehensive performance monitoring

## Advanced Reasoning with MCP

### Pattern Selection

The agent automatically selects reasoning patterns based on task type:

```python
# Coordination tasks use RAISE pattern
task = AgentTask(type="coordination", description="Coordinate distributed analysis")
# → Uses RAISE for multi-agent coordination

# Implementation tasks use ReAct pattern  
task = AgentTask(type="implementation", description="Implement API endpoints")
# → Uses ReAct for iterative development

# Analysis tasks use Chain of Thought
task = AgentTask(type="analysis", description="Analyze system architecture")
# → Uses CoT for systematic analysis
```

### MCP-Aware Reasoning

Reasoning decisions incorporate available MCP capabilities:

```python
# Enhanced reasoning considers:
# - Available MCP tools and their capabilities
# - Tool performance metrics and success rates
# - Dynamic capability discovery results
# - Cross-agent tool usage patterns

reasoning_result = await agent._enhanced_reasoning(task)
print(f"Reasoning pattern: {reasoning_result['reasoning_pattern']}")
print(f"Selected tools: {reasoning_result['selected_tools']}")
print(f"Confidence: {reasoning_result['confidence']}")
```

## Multi-Agent Communication with MCP

### Capability Sharing

Agents can share MCP insights across the network:

```python
# Setup agent communication
await setup_agent_communication("mcp_agent", comm_manager)

# Share MCP capability discovery
await comm_manager.broadcast_insight({
    "agent_id": "mcp_agent",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "insight": "Discovered high-performance Git tools via MCP",
    "tags": ["mcp", "git", "tools", "performance"]
})
```

### Coordinated Tool Usage

Agents coordinate MCP tool usage through the communication system:

```python
# Request coordinated tool execution
await comm_manager.send_coordination_request(
    sender_id="coordinator",
    task_id="distributed_analysis", 
    action_type="execute_mcp_tools",
    recipient_id="executor",
    dependencies=["mcp_capability_assessment"]
)
```

## Unified Tool System

### Tool Execution Priority

The enhanced tool registry executes tools in priority order:

1. **MCP Tools** (highest priority) - Dynamic, external capabilities
2. **New System Tools** - Advanced built-in tool framework
3. **Legacy Built-in Tools** - Fallback compatibility

```python
# Unified tool execution
result = await agent.enhanced_tools.execute_tool(
    tool_name="git_status",
    parameters={"repo": "."},
    agent_id="mcp_agent"
)
# → Tries MCP git tools first, then falls back to built-in
```

### Comprehensive Tool Discovery

Get tools from all available systems:

```python
# Get comprehensive tool information
tool_info = agent.enhanced_tools.get_comprehensive_tool_list()

print(f"Total tools: {tool_info['total_count']}")
print(f"MCP tools: {len(tool_info['mcp_tools'])}")
print(f"New system tools: {len(tool_info['new_system_tools'])}")
print(f"Built-in tools: {len(tool_info['builtin_tools'])}")
```

## Advanced Integration Examples

### RAISE Pattern with MCP Coordination

```python
# Create MCP coordinator with RAISE reasoning
coordinator = MCPEnhancedAgent(
    agent_id="mcp_coordinator",
    communication_manager=comm_manager,
    default_reasoning_pattern="raise",  # Multi-agent coordination
    mcp_enabled=True
)

# Execute RAISE reasoning with MCP context
task = AgentTask(
    type="coordination",  # Triggers RAISE pattern
    description="Coordinate MCP tool usage across agent network"
)

reasoning_result = await coordinator._enhanced_reasoning(task)
# → Executes full RAISE cycle with MCP capability sharing
```

### Cross-Agent MCP Workflow

```python
# Setup multiple MCP-enhanced agents
agents = {
    "coordinator": MCPEnhancedAgent(
        agent_id="coordinator",
        default_reasoning_pattern="raise"
    ),
    "executor": MCPEnhancedAgent(
        agent_id="executor", 
        default_reasoning_pattern="react"
    ),
    "analyzer": MCPEnhancedAgent(
        agent_id="analyzer",
        default_reasoning_pattern="chain_of_thought"
    )
}

# Each agent has access to:
# - Shared MCP server connections
# - Cross-agent communication
# - Unified tool execution
# - Coordinated reasoning patterns
```

## Backward Compatibility

### Graceful Degradation

The integration maintains full backward compatibility:

```python
# If reasoning system unavailable
agent = MCPEnhancedAgent(
    agent_id="basic_agent",
    reasoning_enabled=False  # Falls back to basic MCP functionality
)

# If communication system unavailable  
agent = MCPEnhancedAgent(
    agent_id="isolated_agent",
    communication_manager=None  # Operates independently
)

# If new tool system unavailable
# → Enhanced registry falls back to MCP + built-in tools only
```

### Optional Enhancement

All new features are optional enhancements:

```python
# Basic MCP agent (existing functionality)
basic_agent = MCPEnhancedAgent(
    agent_id="basic",
    mcp_enabled=True
    # All other enhancements default to off/None
)

# Fully enhanced agent
enhanced_agent = MCPEnhancedAgent(
    agent_id="enhanced",
    mcp_enabled=True,
    reasoning_enabled=True,
    communication_manager=comm_manager,
    default_reasoning_pattern="chain_of_thought"
)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Initialization

Components are initialized only when needed:

- Reasoning engine: Only if reasoning_enabled=True
- Communication: Only if communication_manager provided
- New tool system: Only if available and needed

### Efficient Resource Usage

- Tool execution follows priority order to minimize overhead
- MCP connections are reused across reasoning cycles
- Communication is asynchronous and non-blocking

### Monitoring Integration

Performance metrics span all integrated systems:

```python
# Get comprehensive performance data
performance = {
    'mcp_tools': agent.enhanced_tools.performance_metrics,
    'reasoning_paths': agent.reasoning_engine.get_performance_metrics(),
    'communication_stats': comm_manager.get_communication_stats()
}
```

## Migration Guide

### From Basic MCP to Enhanced

```python
# Before: Basic MCP agent
agent = MCPEnhancedAgent(agent_id="agent", mcp_enabled=True)

# After: Enhanced agent with reasoning and communication
comm_manager = CommunicationManager()
agent = MCPEnhancedAgent(
    agent_id="agent",
    mcp_enabled=True,
    communication_manager=comm_manager,  # Add communication
    reasoning_enabled=True,              # Add reasoning
    default_reasoning_pattern="chain_of_thought"
)
```

### Incremental Enhancement

Enable features gradually:

1. **Phase 1**: Add reasoning capabilities
2. **Phase 2**: Add communication for coordination
3. **Phase 3**: Enable advanced patterns like RAISE

## Best Practices

### 1. Pattern Selection

- Use **Chain of Thought** for analysis and planning tasks
- Use **ReAct** for implementation and debugging tasks  
- Use **RAISE** for multi-agent coordination tasks

### 2. Communication Setup

- Initialize communication manager once per agent network
- Subscribe agents to relevant message types only
- Use insight sharing for capability discoveries

### 3. Tool Management

- Let the enhanced registry handle tool prioritization
- Monitor tool performance across all systems
- Use MCP tools for dynamic, external capabilities

### 4. Error Handling

- Always handle graceful degradation scenarios
- Test with components disabled/unavailable
- Provide meaningful fallback behaviors

## Conclusion

The MCP integration with advanced reasoning and communication creates a powerful, unified system that:

- **Preserves** all existing MCP functionality
- **Enhances** agents with sophisticated reasoning capabilities
- **Enables** multi-agent coordination and collaboration
- **Unifies** tool discovery and execution across all systems
- **Maintains** backward compatibility and graceful degradation

This integration transforms the agentic workflow system from sophisticated but isolated agents into a connected intelligence platform capable of leveraging unlimited dynamic capabilities while making intelligent, coordinated decisions.

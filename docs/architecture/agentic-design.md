## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

### MCP Enhancement Layer
The agentic workflow system is enhanced with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, providing:

- **Dynamic Capability Discovery**: Runtime discovery and integration of external tools and data sources
- **Real-time Data Access**: Live connections to databases, APIs, file systems, and development tools
- **External Service Integration**: Seamless integration with Git, IDEs, CI/CD, monitoring, and communication tools
- **Custom Capability Creation**: Framework for building specialized MCP servers for domain-specific needs
- **Secure Resource Access**: Controlled, authenticated access to sensitive external resources

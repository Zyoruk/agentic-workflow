# Advanced Reasoning Patterns

The agentic workflow system includes sophisticated reasoning patterns that enhance agent decision-making and problem-solving capabilities. These patterns provide transparent, systematic approaches to complex problem decomposition.

## Overview

The reasoning system implements multiple AI reasoning paradigms:

- **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: Step-by-step logical reasoning with explicit thought processes
- **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**: Iterative cycles combining reasoning with actions and observations
- **RAISE (Reason, Act, Improve, Share, Evaluate)**: Multi-agent coordination with collaborative learning
- **Memory Integration**: Persistent storage and retrieval of reasoning paths
- **Confidence Tracking**: Quantified confidence levels for reasoning decisions

## Architecture

### Core Components

```python
from agentic_workflow.core.reasoning import (
    ReasoningEngine,
    ReasoningStep, 
    ReasoningPath,
    ChainOfThoughtReasoning,
    ReActReasoning,
    RAISEReasoning
)
```

### ReasoningEngine

The central orchestrator for all reasoning patterns:

```python
reasoning_engine = ReasoningEngine()

# Synchronous reasoning
result = reasoning_engine.reason(
    task_id="task_123",
    agent_id="agent_456", 
    objective="Design a scalable system",
    pattern="chain_of_thought"
)

# Asynchronous reasoning 
result = await reasoning_engine.reason_async(
    task_id="task_123",
    agent_id="agent_456",
    objective="Implement user authentication",
    pattern="react"
)
```

## Chain of Thought (CoT) Pattern

### Description

Chain of Thought reasoning breaks down complex problems into logical, sequential steps. Each step builds upon previous insights to reach a comprehensive solution.

### Key Features

- **Step-by-step decomposition**: Problems broken into manageable components
- **Transparent reasoning**: Each step's logic is explicitly documented
- **Progressive refinement**: Later steps can reference and build on earlier insights
- **Confidence tracking**: Each step and the overall solution receive confidence scores

### Example Usage

```python
# Basic CoT reasoning
result = reasoning_engine.reason(
    task_id="architecture_design",
    agent_id="system_architect",
    objective="Design a microservices architecture for e-commerce platform",
    pattern="chain_of_thought"
)

print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence:.1%}")
print(f"Steps: {len(result.steps)}")

# Access individual steps
for step in result.steps:
    print(f"Step {step.step_number}: {step.question}")
    print(f"Thought: {step.thought}")
    print(f"Confidence: {step.confidence:.1%}")
```

### Typical CoT Flow

1. **Problem Analysis**: Break down the objective into key components
2. **Context Gathering**: Identify relevant information and constraints  
3. **Solution Design**: Develop systematic approach
4. **Implementation Planning**: Define concrete steps
5. **Validation**: Verify solution completeness
6. **Final Answer**: Synthesize comprehensive response

### Performance Characteristics

- **Average Steps**: 4-8 steps for complex problems
- **Confidence Levels**: Typically 80-90% for well-defined problems
- **Execution Time**: Sub-second for most reasoning tasks
- **Memory Usage**: Automatic cleanup after completion

## ReAct Pattern (Reasoning + Acting)

### Description  

ReAct combines reasoning with iterative action-taking and observation. The agent reasons about what to do, takes action, observes the results, and adjusts its approach accordingly.

### Key Features

- **Iterative cycles**: Continuous reasoning-action-observation loops
- **Self-correction**: Ability to adjust approach based on observations
- **Action validation**: Each action is reasoned about before execution
- **Dynamic adaptation**: Strategy evolves based on intermediate results

### Example Usage

```python
# ReAct reasoning for implementation tasks
result = reasoning_engine.reason(
    task_id="feature_implementation", 
    agent_id="developer_agent",
    objective="Implement real-time notification system",
    pattern="react"
)

# Access reasoning-action-observation cycles
for step in result.steps:
    if step.action:
        print(f"Step {step.step_number}:")
        print(f"  Reasoning: {step.thought}")
        print(f"  Action: {step.action}")
        print(f"  Observation: {step.observation}")
```

### Typical ReAct Flow

1. **Initial Reasoning**: Analyze the objective and plan first action
2. **Action Execution**: Take concrete step toward goal
3. **Observation**: Analyze results and outcomes
4. **Re-reasoning**: Adjust strategy based on observations
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Repeat until objective achieved
6. **Completion Check**: Verify goal accomplishment

### Performance Characteristics

- **Average Cycles**: 3-6 reasoning-action cycles for typical tasks
- **Confidence Levels**: Typically 75-85% (slightly lower due to uncertainty)
- **Adaptability**: High - can recover from failed actions
- **Execution Time**: Variable based on action complexity

## RAISE Pattern (Reason, Act, Improve, Share, Evaluate)

### Description

RAISE is an advanced reasoning pattern designed for multi-agent coordination and collaborative problem-solving. It extends the reasoning-acting paradigm with explicit improvement, sharing, and evaluation phases to enable sophisticated agent cooperation.

### Key Features

- **Multi-phase coordination**: Five distinct phases for comprehensive problem-solving
- **Agent communication**: Built-in sharing mechanism for collaborative learning
- **Continuous improvement**: Explicit refinement based on performance analysis
- **Objective tracking**: Dynamic assessment of goal achievement
- **Cross-agent learning**: Insights shared across the agent network

### RAISE Phases

1. **Reason**: Analyze the problem and generate strategic plans
2. **Act**: Execute actions based on reasoning decisions
3. **Improve**: Learn from results and refine approaches
4. **Share**: Communicate insights with other agents in the network
5. **Evaluate**: Assess overall progress and determine next steps

### Example Usage

```python
# RAISE reasoning for multi-agent coordination
from agentic_workflow.core.communication import CommunicationManager

# Setup communication for agent coordination
comm_manager = CommunicationManager()
reasoning_engine = ReasoningEngine(
    agent_id="coordinator_agent",
    communication_manager=comm_manager
)

result = reasoning_engine.reason(
    objective="Design fault-tolerant microservices architecture",
    pattern="raise",
    context={
        "team": ["architect", "developer", "tester", "deployer"],
        "requirements": ["fault_tolerance", "scalability", "monitoring"]
    }
)

# Examine RAISE cycles
for i, step in enumerate(result.steps):
    if "evaluate" in step.thought.lower():
        cycle_num = (i // 5) + 1
        print(f"Cycle {cycle_num} completed with confidence: {step.confidence:.2f}")
        print(f"Objective achieved: {'Yes' if step.confidence >= 0.7 else 'Continuing'}")
```

### Typical RAISE Flow

1. **Reason Phase**: Strategic analysis and plan generation
   - Problem decomposition and context analysis
   - Multiple approach evaluation
   - Strategic decision making

2. **Act Phase**: Concrete action execution
   - Implementation of planned actions
   - Resource allocation and coordination
   - Progress tracking

3. **Improve Phase**: Performance analysis and refinement
   - Results evaluation and learning
   - Approach optimization
   - Confidence adjustment

4. **Share Phase**: Cross-agent communication
   - Insight broadcasting to agent network
   - Knowledge distribution and collaboration
   - Collective intelligence building

5. **Evaluate Phase**: Objective achievement assessment
   - Progress measurement against goals
   - Completion determination
   - Strategy adjustment for next cycle

### Performance Characteristics

- **Average Cycles**: 2-4 RAISE cycles for complex objectives
- **Confidence Levels**: Typically 70-90% (improves over cycles)
- **Collaboration**: High - designed for multi-agent coordination
- **Learning**: Continuous - each cycle builds on previous insights
- **Communication**: Integrated - automatic insight sharing

## Memory Integration

### Reasoning Path Storage

All reasoning paths are automatically stored in the system's memory for later retrieval and analysis:

```python
from agentic_workflow.memory.interfaces import MemoryType

# Reasoning paths stored in both short-term and vector memory
# Short-term: Redis for quick access
# Vector: Weaviate for semantic search and similarity matching
```

### Path Retrieval

```python
# Retrieve reasoning paths by task or agent
task_paths = reasoning_engine.get_reasoning_paths(task_id="task_123")
agent_paths = reasoning_engine.get_reasoning_paths(agent_id="agent_456")

# Search for similar reasoning patterns
similar_paths = reasoning_engine.find_similar_reasoning(
    objective="design system architecture",
    limit=5
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Reasoning Patterns

Extend the system with custom reasoning patterns:

```python
from agentic_workflow.core.reasoning import BaseReasoner

class CustomReasoner(BaseReasoner):
    """Custom reasoning pattern implementation."""
    
    def reason(self, objective: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> ReasoningPath:
        # Implement custom reasoning logic
        pass
        
# Register custom reasoner
reasoning_engine.register_reasoner("custom_pattern", CustomReasoner())
```

### Reasoning Validation

Built-in validation ensures reasoning quality:

```python
# Validation checks:
# - Logical consistency between steps
# - Completeness of reasoning path  
# - Confidence level thresholds
# - Step progression validity

validation_result = reasoning_engine.validate_reasoning(reasoning_path)
if not validation_result.is_valid:
    print(f"Validation issues: {validation_result.issues}")
```

### Performance Monitoring

Track reasoning performance across the system:

```python
# Access performance metrics
metrics = reasoning_engine.get_performance_metrics()
print(f"Average reasoning time: {metrics.avg_reasoning_time}ms")
print(f"Success rate: {metrics.success_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Average confidence: {metrics.avg_confidence:.1%}")
```

## Integration with Agents

### Planning Agent Enhancement

The Planning Agent is enhanced with reasoning capabilities:

```python
from agentic_workflow.agents.planning import PlanningAgent

planner = PlanningAgent(agent_id="strategic_planner")

# Analyze objectives with reasoning
analysis = planner.analyze_objective(
    "Develop comprehensive testing strategy",
    use_reasoning=True  # Enable CoT reasoning
)

# Access both analysis and reasoning insights
print(f"Analysis: {analysis['analysis']}")
print(f"Reasoning Path: {analysis['reasoning_path']}")
print(f"Confidence: {analysis['confidence']}")
```

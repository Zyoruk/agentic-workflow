## ⚠️ Limitations & Dependencies

### External Service Dependencies (Optional)

| Service | Purpose | Impact if Missing |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **OpenAI API** | Code generation, advanced AI | Graceful fallback to mock mode |
| **Redis** | Caching, short-term memory | Falls back to in-memory storage |
| **Weaviate** | Vector storage | Falls back to mock vector store |
| **Neo4j** | Graph database | Graph features unavailable |

### Missing Components (From Architecture Audit)

- **API Layer:** No REST endpoints (agents only usable programmatically)
- **Advanced AI Patterns:** Chain of Thought, ReAct patterns not implemented
- **Production Monitoring:** Limited observability for production deployments

### Integration Examples

#### Enhanced Planning Agent
```python
from agentic_workflow.agents.planning import PlanningAgent

planner = PlanningAgent(agent_id="strategic_planner")
analysis = planner.analyze_objective(
    "Develop comprehensive testing strategy",
    use_reasoning=True  # CoT reasoning enabled
)
```

#### Multi-Step Tool Workflows
```python
from agentic_workflow.tools import ToolManager

# 4-step data processing pipeline
# 1. Read → 2. Analyze → 3. Process → 4. Save
result = await tool_workflow_demo()
```

# Metrics and KPIs Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of metrics and KPIs for our agentic workflow system, focusing on business metrics, performance indicators, and quality metrics.

## Metrics Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Metrics System"
        subgraph "Business Metrics"
            Revenue[Revenue Metrics]
            Growth[Growth Metrics]
            ROI[ROI Metrics]
        end

        subgraph "Performance Metrics"
            Speed[Speed Metrics]
            Efficiency[Efficiency Metrics]
            Resource[Resource Metrics]
        end

        subgraph "Quality Metrics"
            Reliability[Reliability Metrics]
            Accuracy[Accuracy Metrics]
            Satisfaction[Satisfaction Metrics]
        end
    end

    Revenue --> Growth
    Growth --> ROI
    Speed --> Efficiency
    Efficiency --> Resource
    Reliability --> Accuracy
    Accuracy --> Satisfaction
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Business Metrics

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System
    participant Revenue as Revenue Metrics
    participant Growth as Growth Metrics
    participant ROI as ROI Metrics
    participant Report as Business Report

    System->>Revenue: Track Revenue
    Revenue->>Growth: Measure Growth
    Growth->>ROI: Calculate ROI
    ROI->>Report: Generate Report
    Report->>System: Update Status
```

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Revenue Metrics**
   - Track revenue
   - Measure growth
   - Calculate ROI

2. **Growth Metrics**
   - Monitor growth
   - Track progress
   - Measure success

3. **ROI Metrics**
   - Calculate ROI
   - Track investments
   - Measure returns

### 2. Performance Metrics

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System
    participant Speed as Speed Metrics
    participant Efficiency as Efficiency Metrics
    participant Resource as Resource Metrics
    participant Report as Performance Report

    System->>Speed: Measure Speed
    Speed->>Efficiency: Track Efficiency
    Efficiency->>Resource: Monitor Resources
    Resource->>Report: Generate Report
    Report->>System: Update Status
```

#### Implementation Steps:

   - Track consumption
   - Measure efficiency

### 3. Quality Metrics

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System
    participant Reliability as Reliability Metrics
    participant Accuracy as Accuracy Metrics
    participant Satisfaction as Satisfaction Metrics
    participant Report as Quality Report

    System->>Reliability: Measure Reliability
    Reliability->>Accuracy: Track Accuracy
    Accuracy->>Satisfaction: Monitor Satisfaction
    Satisfaction->>Report: Generate Report
    Report->>System: Update Status
```

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Reliability Metrics**
   - Measure uptime
   - Track errors
   - Monitor stability

2. **Accuracy Metrics**
   - Track accuracy
   - Measure precision
   - Monitor quality

3. **Satisfaction Metrics**
   - Monitor satisfaction
   - Track feedback
   - Measure quality

### 4. Metric Collection

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System
    participant Collect as Metric Collector
    participant Process as Metric Processor
    participant Store as Metric Store
    participant Visual as Metric Visualization

    System->>Collect: Collect Metrics
    Collect->>Process: Process Metrics
    Process->>Store: Store Metrics
    Store->>Visual: Visualize Metrics
    Visual->>System: Update Status
```

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Metric Collection**

   - Handle persistence

### 5. KPI Reporting

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant System
    participant KPI as KPI Manager
    participant Analyze as KPI Analysis
    participant Report as KPI Report
    participant Visual as KPI Visualization

    System->>KPI: Track KPIs
    KPI->>Analyze: Analyze KPIs
    Analyze->>Report: Generate Report
    Report->>Visual: Visualize KPIs
    Visual->>System: Update Status
```

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **KPI Management**
   - Track KPIs
   - Monitor progress
   - Measure success

2. **KPI Analysis**

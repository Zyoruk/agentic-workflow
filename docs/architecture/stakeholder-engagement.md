## Engagement Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Engagement System"
        subgraph "Communication"
            Notify[Notification]
            Update[Updates]
            Report[Reporting]
        end

        subgraph "Feedback"
            Collect[Collection]
            Analyze[Analysis]
            Action[Action]
        end

        subgraph "Community"
            Build[Building]
            Manage[Management]
            Grow[Growth]
        end
    end

    Notify --> Update
    Update --> Report
    Collect --> Analyze
    Analyze --> Action

# Agentic Workflow Design

## Levels of Agentic Behavior

### Level 1: AI Workflows (Output Decisions)
- **Focus**: Models making decisions based on natural language instructions
- **Implementation**:
  - Natural language processing for task understanding
  - Decision trees for output selection
  - Basic validation and error checking
  - Integration with existing tools and APIs

### Level 2: Router Workflows (Task Decisions)
- **Focus**: AI models deciding on tools and execution paths
- **Implementation**:
  - Task decomposition and routing
  - Tool selection and orchestration
  - Execution path optimization
  - State management and progress tracking

### Level 3: Autonomous Agents (Process Decisions)
- **Focus**: Complete control over application flow and code generation
- **Implementation**:
  - Self-modifying code capabilities
  - Dynamic tool creation
  - Autonomous problem-solving
  - Learning and adaptation

## Design Patterns and Strategies

### 1. Chain of Thought (CoT)
- **Purpose**: Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- **Implementation**:
  - Task decomposition algorithms
  - Step-by-step reasoning
  - Progress tracking
  - Validation at each step

### 2. ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)
- **Purpose**: Combine reasoning and action in a feedback loop
- **Implementation**:
  - Action planning
  - Execution monitoring
  - Result evaluation
  - Strategy adjustment

### 3. Self-Refine
- **Purpose**: Enable agents to improve their outputs
- **Implementation**:
  - Output evaluation
  - Quality metrics
  - Iterative improvement
  - Learning from feedback

### 4. RAISE (Reasoning, Acting, Interacting, Self-Evaluating)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive approach to agent behavior
- **Implementation**:
  - Multi-agent communication
  - Task coordination
  - Performance evaluation
  - Strategy optimization

### 5. Reflexion
- **Purpose**: Learn from past experiences
- **Implementation**:
  - Experience logging
  - Pattern recognition
  - Strategy adaptation
  - Performance improvement

### 6. LATM (LLMs as Tool Makers)
- **Purpose**: Enable agents to create their own tools
- **Implementation**:
  - Tool generation
  - Tool validation
  - Tool integration
  - Tool optimization

# Monitoring and Metrics Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of monitoring and metrics for our agentic workflow system, focusing on system monitoring, performance metrics, and operational insights.

## Monitoring Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Monitoring System"
        subgraph "System Monitoring"
            Monitor[System Monitor]
            Health[Health Checks]
            Alert[Alert System]
        end

        subgraph "Performance Monitoring"
            Perf[Performance Monitor]
            Metric[Metric Collector]
            Analyze[Performance Analysis]
        end

        subgraph "Operational Monitoring"
            Ops[Operations Monitor]
            Log[Log Manager]
            Report[Report Generator]
        end
    end

    Monitor --> Health
    Health --> Alert
    Perf --> Metric
    Metric --> Analyze
    Ops --> Log
    Log --> Report
```
